# zfactor
This code calculates compressibility factor (z-factor) for natural hydrocarbon gases.

These are the outcomes of the following paper:
Kamyab, M.; Sampaio Jr., J. H. B.; Qanbari, F. & Eustes III, A. W. "Using artificial neural networks to estimate the Z-Factor for natural hydrocarbon gases", Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering, 2010, 73, 248-257

The codes are written in java to calculate the z-factor with 2-5-5-1 and 2-10-10-1 networks.

In addition, a function is developed for DAK method to compare the results of ANN and DAK.
